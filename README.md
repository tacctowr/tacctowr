Fun facts about me!
I'm an amateur writer! Though I'm not currently published, I have many works in progress that I dream of one day hitting the shelves of Barnes and Noble :)
I love animals, and once held a 12-foot Python!
I'm terribly afraid of frogs, they give me the oobie goobies.
My ultimate goal in life is to be a homesteader!
